- numpy==1.19.2
- scikit-learn==0.21.3

## Data availability
In the "datasets" folder, we provide the compressed format of the datasets T1,T2 used in the paper. If you want to use them, please download and unzip them first. 
- drug-disease associations in the T1 dataset were selected from SCMFDD(https://github.com/xiangyue9607/SCMFDD)
- drug-disease associations in the T2 dataset were selected from deepDR(https://github.com/ChengF-Lab/deepDR)
## Usage
### Quick start
We use the dataset T1 to illustrate an example. You should first enter the "datasets" folder and unzip the "T1.zip" file. Then you just need to go back to the MAHGNN file directory and run the following code:

```bash
python main.py --dataset T1
```
###T2 Datesets

```bash
python main.py --dataset folder_name
```
